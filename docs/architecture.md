# RISC-V Multicore Processor Architecture

## Overview

The RISC-V multicore processor implementation consists of four independent cores, each specialized for different types of operations. The architecture follows the RV64I base integer instruction set specification and implements a 5-stage pipeline for each core.

## Core Architecture

### Pipeline Stages

Each core implements a 5-stage pipeline:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
   - Fetches instructions from instruction memory
   - Updates program counter
   - Handles branch prediction
   - Implements instruction cache

2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
   - Decodes instruction format
   - Reads register values
   - Generates immediate values
   - Determines control signals
   - Handles hazard detection

3. **Execute (EX)**
   - Performs ALU operations
   - Handles branch comparisons
   - Manages forwarding paths
   - Implements bypass logic

4. **Memory (MEM)**
   - Performs memory reads/writes
   - Handles load/store operations
   - Manages memory alignment
   - Implements memory protection

5. **Writeback (WB)**
   - Writes results back to registers
   - Handles different writeback sources
   - Manages register file updates
